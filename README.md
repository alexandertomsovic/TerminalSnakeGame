  Initialize a powershell terminal. 
  Run the code: python HighTechHackathon.py

A fully functioning Snake Game initialized and played in a terminal. Created during the June 2021 HighTech Hackathon.

Questions for the Hackathon:

## The inspiration for this game came from the offline google dinosaur game that can be accessed when your computer is not connected to the internet. My friends and I would occasionally get bored in class and turn our Chromebook Wi-Fi off just to play. While experimenting with programs that base out of terminals such as Node, Jupyter, and Anaconda, I would also occasionally get bored and want to relax m mind for a few minutes with a game. What better way to do that then a game that can be accessed inside the terminal. 
## The snake game is a very simple snake game that takes place inside a terminal. (Windows PowerShell Recommended) It uses the arrow keys to move the snake around the screen. 

## We built the program in VS code using python exclusively. The code can be run in a terminal using the code python HighTechHackathon.py (or python + whatever the file has been named + .py) The project must be downloaded into your desktop. We first imported random and curses for the food placements and curses for managing keys. We then created the SW/ SH for the GUI and worked our way from the food spawning to the snakes growth. It was done in only 60 lines, which took a while to get it down to!
